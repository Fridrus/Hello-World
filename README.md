# Hello-World
This is my first repository.
I hope this system will allow me to gain greater accumen in programming.
My skills are meek, but my will is srong. I don't know what I'll do with these acquired skills, but hopefully it will be time well spent.
I have failed the merge several times and have learned from those mistakes. :D
